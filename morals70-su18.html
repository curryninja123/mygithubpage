                    Here is a collection of morals and tips/tricks our section has come up with. This is intended to be a review of section as well as a homework helper and study resource for exams!

                <h4 class="sub-head">6/18 Section 1A - Quantifiers and Logic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>DeMorgan's Extended Law - When negating quantified propositions, existential quantifiers flip to universal quantifiers and vise versa</li>
                    <li>Quantifier order matters!</li>
                    <li>Convert statements to easy English wherever possible.</li>
                    <li>Uniqueness implies that <b>for any</b> two solutions, they are equal.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 class="sub-head">6/19 Section 1B - Proof Techniques</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parity (even vs odd) and order (less than, greater than) are good counter examples for proposition statements. In general, anything that divides a set into disjoint subsets that cover the whole set is a good test for a logical equivalence.</li>
                    <li>If you see "or" statements anywhere in an implication (especially on the right hand side), contraposition is probably a good idea.</li>
                    <li>If your proof seems on the right track but <i>very</i> handwavy or the proof seems difficult to do directly, try contradiction.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 class="sub-head">6/20 Section 1C - Induction</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>For inductive proofs involving sums, it's usually a good idea to break off the last term.</li>
                    <li>When prooving the inductive step, try to separate the expression for the n=k case from the expression for the n=k+1 case algebraically.</li>
                    <li>If the inductive step depends on a term that is not the previous case (that is, something like n=k/2 or n=k-7 rather than n=k-1) then use strong induction.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 class="sub-head">6/21 Section 1D - Well Ordering Principle and Graphs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Properties of trees are useful in proofs about cycles</li>
                    <li>Proofs involving the Well Ordering Principle usually follow from contradiction.</li>
                    <li>Whenever possible, try to prove statements about graphs directly using principles like the Handshake Lemma. These tend to be much more simple than inductive proofs. However, not all statements can be proved in this way.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="sub-head">6/25 Section 2A - Graph Theory</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The number of edges in a planar graph grow linearly with the number of vertices. That is, e = O(v).</li>
                    <li>For proofs about planarity, try to see if you can prove the statement directly with the 3v-6 edge upper bound before relying on techniques such as induction.</li>
                    <li>You can think of a dual of a planar graph as a shape whose corners are incident on all the faces of the original shape. For example, two rectangular pyramids with their bases touching is dual to a cube (imagine this shape inside a cube).</li>
                    <li>Duality has the interesting property that a dual of a dual of a graph is the same graph.</li>
                </ul>
