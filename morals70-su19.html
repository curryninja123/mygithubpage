                    Here is a collection of morals and tips/tricks our section has come up with. This is intended to be a review of section as well as a homework helper and study resource for exams!

                <h4 class="sub-head">6/24 Section 1A - Quantifiers and Logic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implications are OR statements in disguise.</li>
                    <li>DeMorgan's Extended Law - When negating quantified propositions, existential quantifiers flip to universal quantifiers and vise versa. The sets involved remain the same though (don't flip them!).</li>
                    <li>Quantifier order matters when the quantifiers involved are different. Two of the same quantifiers commute, however.</li>
                    <li>Convert statements to easy English wherever possible.</li>
                    <li>Uniqueness implies that <b>for any</b> two solutions, they are equal.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 class="sub-head">6/25 Section 1B - Proof Techniques</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parity (even vs odd) and order (less than, greater than) are good counter examples for proposition statements. In general, anything that divides a set into disjoint subsets that cover the whole set is a good test for a logical equivalence.</li>
                    <li>Try to see if you do a proof directly first.</li>
                    <li>If you see "or" statements anywhere in an implication (especially on the right hand side), contraposition is probably a good idea.</li>
                    <li>If your proof seems on the right track but <i>very</i> handwavy or the proof seems difficult to do directly, try contradiction.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 class="sub-head">6/26 Section 1C - Induction</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Induction is always a good thing to try when dealing with problems that are recursive in nature.</li>
                    <li>For inductive proofs involving sums, it's usually a good idea to break off the last term.</li>
                    <li>When prooving the inductive step, try to separate the expression for the n=k case from the expression for the n=k+1 case algebraically.</li>
                    <li>If the inductive step depends on a term that is not the previous case (that is, something like n=k/2 or n=k-7 rather than n=k-1) then use strong induction.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 class="sub-head">6/27 Section 1D - Introduction to Graphs and Trees</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Properties of trees are useful in proofs about cycles</li>
                    <li>Whenever possible, try to prove statements about graphs directly using principles like the Handshake Lemma. These tend to be much more simple than inductive proofs. However, not all statements can be proved in this way.</li>
                    <li>Induction on graphs follows a notable pattern: for the inductive step, remove a feature you are inducting over (almost always a vertex or edge) from the graph, apply the inductive hypothesis, add it back, and then prove the statement.</li>
                    <li>There are four equivalent definitions of trees (you should understand how they are related, in particular, prove that they are equivalent). Some are more useful than others in proving certain properties of trees, so it's important to choose the right one in your proof. </li>
                </ul>
