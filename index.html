                                            Science Bowl is a competition in which a team of 5 students buzzes in to solve problems in Math, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, Astronomy, and Energy as quickly as possible. In February 2015, my team and I won the Texas A&M Regional Science Bowl. We then proceeded to represent our region at the National Competition in Washington, DC in May. At this competition, we received 7th among about 60 participating schools.

In 2015, I was the lead scorer on my team, which placed 3rd nationally. I was also the highest scoring individual in the state. The next year, I was tied for the second highest in both my state and my school, which tied for 1st nationally.

                                            In May 2015, I represented my school in the field of Science in UIL, a state level academics competition. Our science team placed first by a sizeable margin and we won the overall academics prize. The following year, I was on the Science and Number Sense teams, which won 1st and 2nd place, respectively. We also won 2nd place in overall academics that year.

We programmed a website called <a href="http://principia.herokuapp.com/">Principia</a> in Node.js and Bootstrap. It is essentially a database for teaching mathematical formulas.

                                            In 2013, Instructables offered a contest in which participants had to make an electronic project that was easy to explain to beginners and was very useful at the same time. I created a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/AAA-Robot-Autonomous-Analog-Arduino/">robot</a> that would test various analog sensors and move to a local minimum in the room. This entry earned me fifth place in the competition and a Nexus 7.
